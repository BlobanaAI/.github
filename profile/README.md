🙋‍♀️ Exciting Updates from the Blobana Community!

We are a passionate team of AI developers who fell in love with Blobana. When the original dev went MIA for weeks, the community was in a panic. To keep things moving forward, we decided to step up and lead!

Here’s what we’ve accomplished so far:

Reorganized Codebase: We’ve set up a new GitHub organization to ensure better collaboration and management as multiple devs from Europe, the USA, and Australia have joined forces.
Secured Key Infrastructure: Domain names, hosting services, and the Twitter account are now secured to protect and grow the project.
Open Collaboration: We’re making all our repositories public soon to foster transparency and encourage community contributions.
Thank you for your patience and support! Together, we’re building something incredible. 🚀
