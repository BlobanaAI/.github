## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ We are a team of AI based Devs who fell in love with Blobana since original Dev MIA for weeks. Community was a in panic mode so someone with AI knowledge had to lead. 

We have reorganized the codebase into a new GitHub organization for better collaboration and management since multiple devs wanted to work. We have devs from Europe/USA and Australia are working with this atm.

Secured key infrastructure components:
1) Domain names
2) Hosting services
3) Twitter account

🌈 Contribution guidelines - We will open the Github so community can request the features and it could prioritzed for development. Development is not restricted to us. If you guys want to contribute, just create a new branch and send us the pull request. However, we are protecting main branches since it would trigger CI/CD.
